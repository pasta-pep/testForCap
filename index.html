              <p>Fernestra explores how windows, as vital mediators of light, shape human well-being in interior
                spaces.
                Since humans spend most of their time indoors–about 90% of the day on average, which is roughly 22
                hours
                per day–windows act as thresholds between inside and outside. Filtering light, air, and views of
                nature.
                Their design influences circadian rhythms, cognition, mood, and health, while technological
                innovations
                and cultural values continually reshape their role in everyday life. Focusing on the 20th and 21st
                centuries, this project examines how design, technology, and cultural perspectives intersect to
                redefine
                the window as both a physical element and a cultural symbol in supporting human wellness. Ultimately,
                the window serves as a lens for developing a framework to design spaces that nurture the mind, body,
                and spirit.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Why<br>Windows?</h1>
              <p>I've lived off and on in New York City since 2010, occupying half a dozen apartments across the city.
                In other cities where I've lived, I never worried much about my living space. I never considered how
                big
                my apartment was, how close I was to the train, or how much natural light my bedroom window allowed
                in.
              </p>

              <p>However, every time I moved back to NYC or to a new apartment in a new neighborhood, these thoughts
                crept back into my conscious mind. How close is the subway? How big is the apartment? How much is
                rent?
                How much natural light do I have?
              </p>

              <p>To give more insight into why this is personal: one of my many New York apartments was a large loft
                with tall ceilings and spacious rooms. I lived there for only a few months because my bedroom had no
                window—just a cutout section at the top of the wall where it met the ceiling, allowing only borrowed
                light from an adjacent room with actual window access. This may sound hard to imagine, but it's a
                common
                reality in NYC. Many lofts have windowless rooms, and countless people live in tiny spaces resembling
                closets with no natural light.</p>

              <p>The simple equation is this: the more natural light you have, the wealthier you are—not always, but
                often. I know New York's housing situation is complex, and I don't have a solution, though the system
                clearly needs reform. Beyond socioeconomics, my project brings awareness to natural light and how it
                shapes human well-being in interior spaces.</p>

              <h3 class="subtitle">Light Intensity Thresholds</h3>
              <p>This concentric circle diagram illustrates the Light Intensity Threshold required for circadian rhythm
                regulation, based on research by Lewy (1987) and the American Psychiatric Association New Research
                Abstracts (1987). The innermost circle represents indoor artificial light (100-500 lux), which falls
                below the therapeutic threshold and produces no circadian effect. The second ring marks the therapeutic
                threshold at 2,500 lux—the minimum intensity required for light to influence the human biological clock.
                The third ring represents daylight through windows (2,500-10,000 lux), which exceeds the therapeutic
                threshold and effectively regulates circadian rhythms. The outermost ring depicts direct outdoor
                sunlight (50,000-100,000 lux), which is far above the threshold and provides the most powerful circadian
                signal. The expanding rings visually demonstrate that natural daylight—whether through windows or
                outdoors—provides sufficient intensity to synchronize the human biological clock, while typical indoor
                artificial lighting remains inadequate. This distinction is critical for understanding why access to
                windows and natural light in built environments is a fundamental requirement for mental health, not
                merely an aesthetic preference.

              <h3 class="subtitle">Art of Glass</h3>
              <p>Stained glass became one of Gothic cathedrals' most transformative features during the mid-12th
                century, fundamentally changing how people learned about religion. These illuminated windows served as
                visual biblical sermons that may have impacted congregations even more powerfully than priests' spoken
                words.</p>

              <p>The creation process began with artisans drawing life-sized cartoons as blueprints. Glass was
                produced
                by heating sand and potash to nearly 3000 degrees. While molten, metallic oxides were added for
                color—copper produced green or blue-green, cobalt created deep blue, and gold yielded wine-red or
                violet. The colored glass was blown and flattened into sheets.</p>

              <p>Once cooled, pieces were laid on the cartoon and cracked with hot irons into rough shapes, then
                refined
                through grozing—carefully chipping away excess glass until achieving the precise shape needed. Artists
                sometimes painted details using a dark mixture of iron filings and ground glass suspended in wine or
                urine to block light and define figures' features.</p>

              <p>By the 14th century, silver stain paint emerged, producing yellow tones from pale lemon to deep
                orange
                depending on thickness and firing duration. Finished panels were fitted into H-shaped lead strips
                called
                cames, which prevented colors from blending when viewed from afar. After soldering and waterproofing
                with putty, panels were secured in iron armatures to create the completed window.</p>

              <h3 class="subtitle">Tenement House Act</h3>

              <p>New York's tenement housing crisis centered fundamentally on access to light and air through windows.
                Before any regulation, pre-law tenements (pre-1879) crammed families into apartments where only one room
                had windows—most living spaces remained completely dark and airless.</p>

              <p>The 1879 Tenement House Act attempted reform by prohibiting windowless rooms and requiring all spaces
                have windows facing streets, yards, or air shafts. This created the infamous "dumbbell" design. However,
                these air shafts proved disastrous: too narrow to provide meaningful light or ventilation, they became
                garbage dumps and fire hazards. Adjacent apartment windows sat so close together that privacy vanished
                entirely.
              </p>

              <p>Real progress came with the 1901 Tenement House Act, which mandated that all rooms have genuine window
                access to light and air. Corner locations became preferred because dual street frontages ensured proper
                window exposure—unlike narrow "dumbbell" buildings squeezed between neighbors. After decades of
                windowless rooms and inadequate ventilation, the 1901 law finally guaranteed tenement residents the
                basic human necessity of natural light and fresh air in every room.</p>

              <h3 class="subtitle">Le Forth Point</h3>

              <p>International Style emerged in early 1920s Europe as a response to World War I's devastation,
                becoming the defining modern architectural movement of the 20th century. Founded by Le Corbusier, Walter
                Gropius, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, it emphasized industrial materials (steel, concrete, glass),
                minimal ornament, and machine-age precision.</p>

              <p>Le Corbusier's Five Points of a New Architecture established core principles: free plans, free facades,
                ribbon windows, and roof terraces. The most important aspect of ribbon windows was to blur the boundary
                between exterior and interior and emphasize the building's link to nature. They were the fourth point in
                Le Corbusier's system.
              </p>

              <p>International Style symbolized industrial advancement and modern living—embodied in Le Corbusier's
                dictum: "a house is a machine for living." After WWII, it became America's unofficial corporate
                architecture and spread globally, particularly influencing Latin America and Asia before declining in
                the 1960s.</p>

              <h3 class="subtitle">Rise of Sanatoriums</h3>

              <p>Between the mid-1800s and mid-1900s, Europe developed specialized sanatoria where patients accessed
                outdoor activity, exercise routines, and nutritious meals. These therapeutic retreats first appeared in
                Poland, Germany, and Switzerland. The emphasis on hygiene intensified following the Spanish flu pandemic
                of 1918-1920 and rising tuberculosis rates.</p>

              <p>The modernist movement of the 1920s and '30s elevated functionality and health to the forefront of
                architectural thinking. Buildings designed to keep people healthy became hallmarks of the movement, with
                windows emerging as crucial healing tools. Architects maximized natural light through large,
                strategically positioned glazing—understanding that sunlight possessed genuine therapeutic power against
                tuberculosis.
              </p>

              <p>Alvar Aalto's 1932 Sanatorium Paimio exemplifies this philosophy. The building's most striking feature
                is its expansive ribbon windows—long horizontal bands of glass that flood patient rooms with healing
                sunlight throughout the day. The crisp white structure, resembling a ship anchored among Finnish pines,
                connects with nature through these continuous windows and expansive balconies. Aalto positioned windows
                to capture optimal southern light, recognizing that constant sun exposure and fresh air were not
                amenities but medical necessities. These became the building's organizing principles rather than
                aesthetic afterthoughts.</p>

                American Art, New York (1977), which first debuted at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1977 and
                reappeared 35 years later in summer 2013.</p>

              <p>Comprises just three materials—a semi-translucent white scrim, a black aluminum beam, and a painted
                black line—that transform the fourth-floor gallery into an indoor abstracted landscape. The scrim,
                adjacent the left edge of the window and suspended from ceiling to 5 feet 6 inches above the floor
                across the 117-foot length, is anchored by the three-inch-thick aluminum beam and complemented by a
                matching three-inch black line painted around the gallery's perimeter at the same height. </p>

              <p>Creating shifting horizons that make the space feel larger than it is while meticulously registering
                the constantly changing natural light from the gallery's single window source, which varies every second
                with time of day and weather conditions, fading and dimming from window to back wall in precise
                gradations across the scrim's white surface.</p>

              <h3 class="subtitle">Access To Light</h3>

              <p>During the 1980s, research established that window access and natural light exposure are fundamental
                requirements for mental health, not aesthetic amenities. Alfred J. Lewy's 1987 study revealed that
                sunlight—twenty to two hundred times brighter than indoor light—is the only light source intense enough
                to regulate human circadian rhythms and suppress melatonin production. Artificial lighting remains
                insufficient for circadian regulation, while natural daylight through windows provides adequate
                stimulation when individuals are positioned close to window sources.
              </p>

              <p>The 1987 American Psychiatric Association studies demonstrated that morning light advanced delayed
                circadian rhythms in depressed patients, while research on normal subjects showed even subclinical
                seasonal symptoms responded to increased natural light. Sudden disruptions to light schedules increased
                psychiatric crisis presentations, underscoring human vulnerability to inconsistent natural light
                patterns.
              </p>

              <p>British physicians Finnegan, Pickering, and Burge found sealed air-conditioned buildings produced three
                to four times higher rates of lethargy, headaches, and depression compared to naturally ventilated
                buildings with windows. Symptoms remained elevated throughout entire days lacking adequate natural
                light. Experts recognized natural light's importance but lacked implementation guidance, leaving
                millions in sealed environments experiencing population-level psychiatric harm through chronic circadian
                disruption.</p>

              <h3 class="subtitle">Light in Interiort</h3>

              <p>Research over the past fifteen years demonstrates that natural light ranks as one of the most valued
                features in interior spaces. A 2010 Harvard Business Review study identified it as the number one office
                perk employees seek, while Interface's Human Spaces research found that 44% of employees favor natural
                light above all other natural features.
              </p>

              <p>Biophilic design goes beyond adding plants to rooms. It recognizes humanity's evolutionary connection
                to nature and our deep psychological need for natural environments. When we position plants near
                windows, particularly in urban settings, we blur the boundaries between interior and exterior spaces,
                creating direct connections with living systems that provide immediate sensory engagement and trigger
                stress-reducing responses.
              </p>

              <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified this demand for natural light in interior space, particularly in
                residential markets. A Marvin study revealed that 77% of homebuyers are willing to pay premium prices
                for natural sunlight, elevating light from a mere preference to a top priority that directly influences
                purchasing decisions.</p>
